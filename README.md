As I work through the kata on Codewars, I'll be using this repo as a playground to find solutions and upload my solutions to GitHub once I've gotten a solution that works.

Will also be using this, similarly, as a playground, and as a catalog of answers for Hackerrank preparation questions. The format of hackerrank problems was not covered at all in the bootcamp I graduated so this is a way to familiarize myself and be more apt and at the ready for any Coding Exams sent my way by potential employers.

With time I'll likely be going back and cleaning up / simplifying any older responses that weren't as efficient as they could have been as I learn more. 

This repo will function as a publicly viewable set of notes and thought processes.
