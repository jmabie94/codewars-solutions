As I work through the kata on Codewars, I'll be using this repo as a playground to find solutions and upload my solutions to GitHub once I've gotten a solution that works.

With time I'll likely be going back and cleaning up / simplifying any older responses that weren't as efficient as they could have been as I learn more. 

This repo will function as a publicly viewable set of notes and thought processes.
